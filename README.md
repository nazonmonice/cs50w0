Hello!
For project0 I chose to do my topic on scuba diving in The Bahamas because I am a Bahamian (born and raised) as well as being a professional PADI Dive Master. I've been scuba diving for almost 8 years and I've worked in the industry for 3 and a half years so choosing a topic was very easy for me. This is my first web programming class which I am enjoying thoroughly, some applications I am still unfamilar with but I am eager to learn them successfully.
I hope my project0 finds you well.
